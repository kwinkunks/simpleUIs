ABOUT Simple LAS X Plot:

Requires:
-Python version 2.7.9
-PyQt4
-pyqtgraph version 0.9.10

This UI is an extension of Simple LAS Curve Viewer.  It allows the user to import an LAS (.las) file and cross plot the values on another plot region.

To begin, open terminal:
$ python main.py

This will start the GUI.  Then go to File->import las.  This will open a dialog box.  Select an las file.  Double-click on a curve name to view it.
The top list corresponds to the left curve plot and the X or bottom axis of the cross plot.  The bottom list corresponds to the right curve plot and the Y or left axis of the cross plot.

This program was designed to be an interactive visualization of the various curves in a well log (las file).

It is built using PyQt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for the GUI and pyqtgraph (http://pyqtgraph.org/) for the plotting library.
